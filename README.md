# Polygons

p5.js Game

Alien CFOs (Circular Falling Objects) are being reported raining from the sky. You live in a polygonal world, which means you distrust and fear anything with curvature (rightfully so). 

Your task is to eliminate all CFOs by enclosing them in polygons as they fall, which also happens to earn you points. A triangle is worth 3 points for every circle eliminated, a square 4 points, and so on. Polygons can be any size. The larger the size, the more points you will likely gain. 

However, once you draw a complete polygon, that polygon is locked into place where you drew it, whether it eliminated circles or not. New circles will bounce off these drawn polygons as they continue to rain down.

You lose if you draw a polygon that intersects with a pre-existing polygon or if a circle makes it to earth. 

Circles will fall faster and in greater number as time goes on.
